# Functional Programming For Students in a Hurry

## What is functional programming?

Functional programming is a **programming paradigm** (a process / philosophy / way of programming) that tries to make programming more concise and effective by cutting out unnecessary components.

Unlike Object Oriented Programming (OOP) (another programming paradigm) has classes, global variables, and changing states, Functional Programming sticks to using functions that return consistent results. This means that functions in functional programming typically **do not** change variables outside of them.

## Why learn it?

Although it's seen as difficult to learn, functional programming actually makes programming **a heck of a lot easier** as the code is:

- Easier to read

- Easier to debug

- Less likely to have the strange wonky side-effect problems that OOP is so famous for

- Often runs quicker and takes up less space than OOP equivalents

This is why you'll often see functional programming when working with Big Data--you're working through massive amounts of data and need things to go as quick, efficiently, and bug free as possible.

## Should I use OOP or Functional Programming?

Typically, you'll see both to varying degrees.

Since OOP and Functional Programming are **ways of coding** and not programming languages themselves, you're free to pick and choose as you go. Each paradigm is great at some things but not so good at others (though avid proponents of each paradigm would probably disagree and go above and beyond to explain why this isn't the case; programming paradigms and programming languages are kind of like sports teams for programmers).

In our class, we don't really go over functional programming in depth, but lamdba functions and list comprehensions are typically cited as evidence that Python is a great language to use for functional programming--hence why it was brought up in the module.
